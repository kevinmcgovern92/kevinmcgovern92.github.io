  <h1>The Wheel of Time</h1>
  <h2>By Robert Jordan & Brandon Sanderson</h2>
  <p>The Wheel of Time is a grand fantasy series that spans 14 books. The author, Rober Jordan, has influenced George R.R. Martin considerably. But the area in which that seems most true is that neither of them can meet deadlines or keep their books short enough (Wheel of Time was originally supposed to be 6 books).</p>

    <h3>So what is this about anyways?</h3>
    <p>Though this series is near and dear to me, it suffers from a few structural flaws that cause people to discount it off hand:</p>
    <ul class="list">
      <li>All of the main characters are 18-20 at the start of the story</li>
      <li>14 books is a <strong>high</strong> barrier to entry</li>
      <li>A cataclysmic battle between dark and light to determine the fate of the earth sounds too much like Tolkien</li>
      <li>In case 14 books didn't sound intimidating, it's 11,582 pages</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Now to some, the length is either not an issue or a hard stop, so I won't go into that. But what about the other issues? I will now attempt to justify the other criticisms and convince you to read these books!</p>

    <h3>Why you should read</h3>
    <p>The age of the main characters has led some to derisively label Wheel of Time as a children's or young adult series. That would be a mistake. These books rely on the common trope of "abilities manifesting themselves at maturity." This allows the reader to go on the same journey as the characters in terms of learning more about the world. The series starts in a backwoods town so small that nobody who lives there can remember the last time they saw a tax collector. So as the main characters come to understand their powers and the wider world around them, so too does the reader. And it is an <strong>incredibly</strong> large world -- so large that new locations are rolled out pretty much until the final book. And yes, the age of the characters does mean there will be mellow drama and romance, it's mostly well written and you can get past it. There are also main characters whose hormones aren't raging!</p>
    <p>But what about the too-Tolkienesque final cataclysmic battle? To understand why it's different, you need to understand the Dark One - Wheel of Time's big baddy. The Dark one is a bit like Sauron in that it had been "defeated" previously and now everyone thought the threat was gone forever. Except the Dark One was never corporeal, just a sentient mass of dark energy  who was working his way out of his cage. Because of this, there's sort of a Game of Thrones vibe throughout the books but instead of people saying "The White Walkers don't exist" they would say "Trollocs have been dead for centuries" and refuse to consider that they live in anything except a mundane world. There's another big difference too: Sauron has "men from the east" in his army, and a few notable turncoats like Grima Wormtongue. The Dark one also gets his foreign barbarian horde, but he has human followers in every civilization at every level of power. So it's not just the misshapen monsters on the battlefield that the protagonists have to contend with, but also nobles who will try to foil their plans, innkeepers who will try to murder them in the night, soldiers actively undermining their own army, and the list goes on. There is no united front of humans against the hordes of evil, because a bunch of humans have been promised a sweet deal when the world plunges into chaos.</p>
    <p>One thing that Jordan definitely deserves credit for is not relying on Tolkien's creatures. There are no Orcs, Goblins, Dwarves, Elves, or Trolls. Instead you get <a href= "http://wot.wikia.com/wiki/Trolloc">Trollocs</a>, <a href= "http://wot.wikia.com/wiki/Myrddraal">Myrddraal</a>, and <a href= "http://wot.wikia.com/wiki/Draghkar">Draghkar</a>. It is easy to see where Jordan got the inspiration for each of them, but they are unique to this universe. At the very least, this serves to differentiate the two.</p>
    <p>One more thing that remains to be said about this series is that it has a very unique magical system. It's incredibly complicated, but one way to think about it is that there are a few "magical elements" like fire, water, air, etc. that are combined in various compisitions and patterns to make things happen. Suffice to say, it's complicated and awesome.</p>
