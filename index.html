    <h3>On comparisons of the fantasy genre</h3>
    <p>As an avid lover of fantasy, I am more than accutely aware that the lack of subgenres with any semantic use ("high fantasy" has never meant much to me) creates great difficulty in differentiating titles and series. With science fiction, you have near-future, cyberpunk, dystopian, and many other subgenres or combination of those therein - and this sort of segmentation allows the reader to have a better idea of whether the title suits their tastes.</p>
    <p>With fantasy titles, this becomes much more difficult. As soon as you mention Orcs or Goblins, people will think Tolkein. Mention magic and people's thoughts could wander into the realm of Harry Potter. Think intrigue and shcemes are core to your favorite series? Well, you've just set up a comparison to Game of Thrones.</p>

    <p>My point is that it can be difficult to explain the world of a series without relying on analogies, but that will only cause your recommendee to form their own (often ill-informed) opinion about whatever you've been talking about. I'm not going to solve this problem, but will attempt to give two of my favorite "under the radar" series a fair introduction, and provide some cool info about those that are near and dear to the mainstream.</p>
