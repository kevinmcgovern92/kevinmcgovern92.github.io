    <h3>On comparisons of the fantasy genre</h3>
    <p>As an avid lover of fantasy, I am more than accutely aware that the lack of subgenres with any semantic use ("high fantasy" has never meant much to me) creates great difficulty in differentiating titles and series. With science fiction, you have near-future, cyberpunk, dystopian, and many other subgenres or combination of those therein - and this sort of segmentation allows the reader to have a better idea of whether the title suits their tastes.</p>
    <p>With fantasy titles, this becomes much more difficult. As soon as you mention Orcs or Goblins, people will think Tolkein. Mention magic and people's thoughts could wander into the realm of Harry Potter. Think intrigue and shcemes are core to your favorite series? Well, you've just set up a comparison to Game of Thrones.</p>

    <p>My point is that it can be difficult to explain the world of a series without relying on analogies, but that will only cause your recommendee to form their own (often ill-informed) opinion about whatever you've been talking about. I'm not going to solve this problem, but will attempt to give two of my favorite "under the radar" series a fair introduction.</p>
  </section>
<p>To demonstrate this difficulty, I will compare my 4 favorite fantasy series to each other.</p>

<p>See? Even though these are all very different series, if you try to boil them down to key elements, you could be forgiven for not seeing any difference between them. See below for links to the other pages and explanations of Wheel of Time and Malazan Book of the Fallen</p>
<p>To look at a similar webpage, I chose <a href ="http://www.dragonmount.com/index.php">Dragonmount.com</a> which is a Wheel of Time community website. Looking at the source code, there are a few things I see that make it very different from my own page:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Lots of Javascript</li>
  <li>CSS styling</li>
  <li>Div tags with attributes to keep everything properly aligned</li>
  <li>li tags with attributes (class=)</li>
  <li>Social media integration and the associated links/images</li>
  <li>Notes in the source code; the home page is over 1200 lines of code, so I can see how this would come in handy</li>
</ul>
