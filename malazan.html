<h1>The Malazan Book of the Fallen</h1>
<h2>By Steven Erikson</h2>
<p>The Malazan Book of the Fallen is probably the most complicated series I've ever read, but also has a high barrier to entry. Probably the most interesting part about the world is how pluralistic it is. Humans of many different cultures coexist with non-humans of a similar breadth of species and cultures.</p>

<h3>So what's going on with this story?</h3>
<p>Though it may be shorter than Wheel of Time at 10 books and 8,889 pages, it's incredibly complicated and dense. In the vein of A Song of Ice and Fire/Game of Thrones, there are many characters, and lots of them that seem really important die. It's also dark and real in the same way, and you won't be able to get away fromsome gruesome parts of war.</p>
<p>So what else does the series have aside from gritty realness?</p>
<ul class="list">
  <li>An amazing magic system so complex that even the characters using it don't fully understand</li>
  <li>A broad and constantly expanding universe with fascinating characters</li>
  <li>'Shades of Grey' morality
  <li>A writer who casually weaves philosophy throughout the books</li>
  <li>Amazing bits of humor</li>
  <li>A pantheon of Gods that meddle in mortal affairs</li>
</ul>
<p>There's even more to the series that I don't have time to go into here, but I will update in the future!</p>
